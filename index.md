## Overview 

In safety critical domains, software engineers must ensure traceability between requirements and system test cases to comply with safety standards, e.g. ISO-26262. Requirements management tools like IBM Doors are commonly adopted in industry, but these tools provide support for only the maintenance of traceability links. Software engineers thus have both to manually derive system test cases from functional requirements written in natural language and establish traceability links between requirements and their corresponding test cases. 

UMTG is a toolset for automatically generating executable and traceable system test cases from use case specifications and domain model. In order to extract behavioral information from use case specifications and enable test automation, UMTG employs Natural Language Processing (NLP), a restricted form of use case specifications, and constraint solving.

UMTG is integrated with two tools, IBM Doors and IBM Rational Rhapsody that are widely adopted in industry to manage requirements and design systems. UMTG has been successfully evaluated on two industrial case studies. UMTG integrates a component for the automated generation of OCL constraints from sentences in natural language, OCLGen, which is available from teh fllowing [link](https://sntsvv.github.io/OCLGen/).

UMTG has been depevoled in a project in collaboration with [IEE](http://www.iee.lu).

## Download & Installation

### Eclipse plug-in

#### System Requirements

The UMTG Eclipse plug-in has been tested on Windows 7 with:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.7.0 and above
2. Telelogic DOORS 8.3 
3. IBM Rational Rhapsody 8.0.3
4. GATE Framework 7.1 release [Download]

A version of UTMG that does not require Telelogic DOORS will be released soon.

#### Installation

1. Download the Installation Package from the following link : [UMTG Distribution.zip](https://sntsvv.github.io/UMTG/data/UMTG_Distribution.zip).
2. To install UMTG, please follow the UMTG User Manual : [UMTG_Manual.pdf](https://sntsvv.github.io/UMTG/data/UMTG_Manual.pdf).

### Replicability package and command line toolset

#### System Requirements

The UMTG command line toolset works with Unix-like systems with Bash shell.

#### Genration of OCL constraints (OCLgen)

A reusable replicability package for the OCL generation technique is available from the following URL https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Jbg_DdschJpYDmiPkQiloBBgBdWfMNW_

The package includes also the sources of OCLgen and all its dependencies.

#### Use Case Test Models and Test Cases Generation

The use case specifications provided by our industry partner cannot be released because covered by NDA. We are working on a solution to provide a sanitized version of the generated test models.
